A modern web-based implementation of MIT Scratch, built with React, Vite, React Beautiful Drag-and-drop, and React-Draggable. This application allows users to visually program and animate sprites through a drag-and-drop interface.

## Features

- **Sprite Manipulation**: Control sprite movements, rotations, and other actions.
- **Draggable Interface**: Easily move and position sprites on the canvas.
- **Undo/Redo**: Easily undo and redo actions to manage changes.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Vite**: For fast development and build processes.
- **React Beautiful DND**: For creating drag and drop block-based programming environments.
- **React-Draggable**: For enabling draggable functionality in React components.
